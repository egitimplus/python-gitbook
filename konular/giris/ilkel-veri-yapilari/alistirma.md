```python
# Let's create an object called "a" and assign it the number 5
a = 5

# Adding the objects
print(a + a) # 10
print(a)     # 5

# Reassignment
a = 10

# Check
print(a)     # 10

# Yes! Python allows you to write over assigned variable names. 
# We can also use the variables themselves when doing the reassignment. 

# Use A to redefine A
a = a + a
# a += a

# Check 
print(a)     # 20
```
